## Overview

JavaScript project ideas crafted to enhance and refine your expertise in integrating APIs into web applications:

- The NASA API Project employed the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API to dynamically present data associated with a specific historical date selected by the user

- The Chuck Norris API Project offers users the choice to either generate a Chuck Norris joke or select a category. The web application then harnesses the Chuck Norris API to fetch and display a joke corresponding to the chosen category

- In the DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) API Project, users are prompted to input the name of a DnD spell. Subsequently, the web application leverages a specialized API to provide comprehensive and pertinent information about the specified spell

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This project involves the development of unique web applications with custom APIs, using vanilla Javascript. The goal of this project was to experiment and develop my personal coding abilty and understanding of javascript. These projects are completely functional, aesthetically pleasing and interactable.

For the purpose of the demo, the website is currently hosted on Netlify.

## Optimizations

1. Better Error-handelling and factor into account edge cases in interactability
2. More features and functionalities could be added in the future
